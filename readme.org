** prerequisites
*** Uniform and same image sizes
Both rail and knob image must have uniform scales (they must be a drawn inside a square) and must have the same size.
***  Disable preserveAspectRatio
When you use SVG the ~preserveAspectRatio~ attribute must be set to "none" on the svg root element. In the absence of the attribute Firefox will default to ~XMidYMid~, which will prevent the non-uniform scaling of your rail image.
** Hints
Set ~user-select~ CSS property to ~none~ for your slider to prevent users from accidently selecting it.
